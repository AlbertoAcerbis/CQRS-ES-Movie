A CQRS microservice with event sourcing, from develop to non conventional testing
This is the repository for the Italian Agile Days 2018's workshop. The scope is to show a way to test events in a CQRS with event sourcing application.

Prerequisites
Visual Studio 2017 (Community edition is enough) or Visual Studio Code
.NET Core 2.1
RabbitMQ
MongoDB
Event Store
Muflone in this project is a "lite" version of our production code, but both are based on the great work of Jonathan Oliver with CommonDomain inside NEventStore
